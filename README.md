## Tech Stack
This application is written with a React Frontend for the client that is tested using Jest and Enzyme. The server is written using the Django Framework.
React is an easy to use framework and is easy to maintain, therefore it was an easy choice for the frontend.
Due to a desire for rapid development of the application, as well as the very possible need for a database in future features,
Django was the appropriate choice for the backend
